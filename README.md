p5.js

This is the Template Repl for p5.js.

p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

[Check out the official docs here](https://p5js.org/reference/).

File Overview
← script.js
This is where we will add the JavaScript code for our game.

← assets
Drag in assets, like images, to add them to your project. If you are adding an image, it is best to save it to your computer, then upload the file to the assets folder. The url of the image will be assets/example.jpg or assets/example.png.

← index.html
The HTML file contains HTML code that sets up a webpage for our game. We also add libraries in this file using HTML tags.

← README.md
That's this file. This is the place to tell people more about what your game does and how you built it.

← style.css
The CSS file adds styling rules to your content like changing colors and fonts. We will not use this file for our game and instead update the style of our game in the script.js file.
